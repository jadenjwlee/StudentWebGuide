	<p id="map_p">In 2009, the Sustainability Coordinating Committee created Humber’s first sustainability website as a project in co-operation with the Humber 
	AdCentre. In conjunction with Humber’s Marketing team, School of Media studies and former Humber film and web development students, interactive maps of the 
	North and Lakeshore campuses were created to highlight sustainability initiatives implemented on campus.</p>
